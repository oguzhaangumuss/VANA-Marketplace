## 4. Known Issues & Limitations

1. Gas Costs

   - Batch minting limited to 20 NFTs
   - Creator payment distribution scales with creator count

2. Time Constraints

   - All timestamps must be UTC
   - Start time must be future
   - End time must be after start time

3. Upgrade Risks

   - Storage layout changes
   - Implementation contract verification

4. Branch Coverage
   - Current coverage: 54.62%
   - Some error conditions not fully tested
   - Complex conditions need more test cases

## 5. External Dependencies

- OpenZeppelin Contracts v4.9.6
  - ERC721Upgradeable
  - AccessControlUpgradeable
  - UUPSUpgradeable
  - PausableUpgradeable

## 6. Documentation Status

- [x] Technical Documentation

- [x] Deployment Guide
- [x] Test Coverage Report

## 7. Security Considerations

1. Access Control

   - Role-based access for admin functions
   - Two-step role transfers
   - Emergency pause mechanism

2. Payment Security

   - Pull over push pattern for withdrawals
   - Safe math operations
   - Reentrancy guards

3. Upgrade Safety
   - UUPS pattern implementation
   - Storage gaps for future upgrades
   - Access control on upgrade function
